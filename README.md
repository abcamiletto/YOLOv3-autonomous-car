A custom, from scratch, implementation of a YOLOv3-like architecture trained on Berkeley Deep Drive Dataset to detect and localize obstacle on the road.

You can find a full demo on this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2l1U2I18HQ), here's a preview:

When in doubt, always look at the Notebook instead of the python code: those are the one i kept on using on the final stage
