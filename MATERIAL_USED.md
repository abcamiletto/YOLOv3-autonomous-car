## References

This part below was written at the start of the project: you can find everything it might have been useful in this project

Main publications given in the lectures [SegNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561.pdf), [FCN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4038.pdf), [DilatedConv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07122.pdf)

### Main datasets available
Inside the parenthesis there are the main tasks i'm looking into.
      
1. **https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/** (road object detection or instance segmentation)
2. http://apolloscape.auto/scene.html (scene parsing or instance segmentation)
3. https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com (instance segmentation)

### Repo References
Right below there's interesting stuff i found googling for a while
 - [https://github.com/mrgloom/awesome-semantic-segmentation](https://github.com/mrgloom/awesome-semantic-segmentation) Big repositories of implementations in different framework of segmentation tasks of different genres.
 - [https://github.com/lsh1994/keras-segmentation](https://github.com/lsh1994/keras-segmentation) Really simple implementation of main CNN architectures, might be useful to start from here.
 - [https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras) Same as before, but it's a better work overall so it might be an overkill.
 - [https://github.com/TheMoskowitz/Semantic_Segmentation_for_Autonomous_Driving](https://github.com/TheMoskowitz/Semantic_Segmentation_for_Autonomous_Driving) cool implementation, really similar to what i wanna do.

### Setup

I've created a Conda Env and installed Anaconda in it to be able to use Jupyter Notebook
